title: Disclaimer on Use of Book Covers and Materials
---

This project is a scholarly, non-commercial resource designed to promote the discovery of Black Latin American writers.

The book cover images used on this site are for identification, commentary, and scholarly reference purposes only. They are sourced from publicly available platforms (such as Amazon) or reproduced from physical copies held by the Hesburgh Library and partner institutions via interlibrary loan.

We believe the use of these low-resolution images constitutes a **"fair use"** as defined in the United States copyright law for the following reasons:
*   **Purpose and Character:** The use is non-commercial, educational, and transformative, as it provides scholarly context and analysis.
*   **Nature of the Copyrighted Work:** The images are factual, published book covers.
*   **Amount and Substantiality:** Only low-resolution cover images are used, which is the minimal amount necessary to achieve the scholarly purpose.
*   **Effect upon the Potential Market:** This use does not substitute for the original work and does not harm the market for or value of the copyrighted books.

Our fair use analysis is documented following guidelines provided by the [Columbia University Libraries Fair Use Checklist](https://copyright.columbia.edu/basics/fair-use/fair-use-checklist.html).
